#Iot Electic Meter

The purpose of this project is to develop an IoT electric meter, which collects all the meter data. The IoT meter sends the necessary meter data filtering out irrelevant ones to a central server via a wireless communication mean. The data of all the meters is processed in the central server, and decisions should be taken using the central server. If any sort of tampering is attempted, the server gives an immediate automated response and turns off the power supply. Also, if the bills are due, the server would warn the user, and then if necessary cuts off the line.
